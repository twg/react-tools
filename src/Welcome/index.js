    <h1>Welcome to the React Component Library</h1>
    <p>
      This is a visual library and playground for common components used by
      TWGers that leverages <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as
      many stories as you want.
      <br />
      (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This component library is most effective when used hand in hand with TRT,
      which you can find additional documentation for on{' '}

        our github page
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Components in this library are typically smaller UI pieces that are very
      agnostic and should be easy to override / customize.
